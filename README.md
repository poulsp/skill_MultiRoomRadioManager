This skill requires and depends on the skill [MultiRoomMediaVolume](https://github.com/poulsp/skill_MultiRoomMediaVolume).
You also need the standalone [PspMultiRoomPlayer](https://github.com/poulsp/PspMultiRoomPlayer).

You can create a widget in menupoint "WIDGET" with where you can list/play/stop stations.

You play a radio station with voice by saying e.g "radio 14" and the responses from alice "Tuning in to radio 14, 1.FM - Blues." and stop it by saying  "stop radio".

##### Controlling the volume by voice
	"volume up"
	"increase volume"
	"volume up 5"
	"increase volume by 5", "volume up at office 5 percent"
	same "volume down", "decrease volume"
	"get volume" "tell me the volume", "get volume at kitchen"

	"volume 11"
	"set the volume to 46 at kitchen"
	"mute", "mute volume", "volume mute", "volume mute at office",
	"unmute", "unmute volume", "volume unmute", "volume unmute at bedroom",


##### Other voice commands
	"tell me the station playing", "what station playing", "who is playing"
	"radio 11", "radio 37 at everywhere", "radio 23 at dining room", "play radio station 45"


##### Play at additional Rooms:
	"play at outdoor", "play at kitchen"


##### Moving stream:
	"move to lounge", "move to office"


In the skills folder ~/ProjectAlice/skills/MultiRoomRadioManager there is a folder utils/UpdatePrintRadiolist, in there we have a standalone app  UpdatePrintRadiolist.py and a file called radio_stations.csv.

To make changes in the radio list stations you add/change them in file 'radio_stations.csv', just with a normal text editor.
Then run ./update_print_radioliste.py and the radio stations is updated on the fly in Alice.

The folder can be copied to another location if preferred.


You can test by download to alice skill folder.

cd ~/ProjectAlice/skills

git clone https://github.com/poulsp/skill_MultiRoomMediaVolume MultiRoomMediaVolume

git clone https://github.com/poulsp/skill_MultiRoomRadioManager MultiRoomRadioManager


Use the [PspMultiRoomPlayer](https://github.com/poulsp/PspMultiRoomPlayer) to play the actual sound/music
But you donâ€™t need that for testing if the radio works. There is a built-in web player in the MultiRoomMediaVolume widget.
